# MA615_FinalProject
## Instruction
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating effect on the economy in the United States. In early March
2020, the first lockdowns began and the stock market plunged. After this initial reaction, however, the market
recovered.
In this assignment, we assume an intial position of $250,000 in cash on 2020-07-01 and invest 6 stocks using
investment advice before 1 July from ETF. We track the value of our portfolio using last close prices through
the fall to 2020-12-01. At the end of 2020-12-01, we have a position of $495,201 in cash.
The goal of the final project is only to demonstrate our skill.
